**Background**

         In the use of Geographic Information Systems, there are many among us who do not know how to use the data in the editor. At the 6th meeting of the Geographic Information System, I'll explain how to use editor. Editor functions for editing the shapefile, which is where this editor can create a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) on the shapefile file.

Creative Solutions
            Editor functions for editing on a shapefile. Contohmya delete road. In addition there is also the editor of Writer, Writer is a method in shape file to create a new shp file (shp and dbt)
For langkag-steps in the editor as follows:
Import shape file
**Sf = shape file.editor (war.shp)
Sf.point (16,10,0,0)
Sf.record ( 'field')
Sf.save
Sf.save ( 'war.shp')
a = shapefile.reoder ( 'war.shp')
a.recorders ()
a.shapes (). points
a.shape () [0]
a.shape () [0] points
[(10,0,10,0)]**

to delete
**Sf.delete (0)
a.shapes () [0] .points [(10,0,10,0)]
sf.points [16,10,0,0]
sf.record ( 'field')
sf.saver ( 'wr.shp')**

**Conclusion**
Editor functions for editing on a shapefile. Many things can be done in the editor. Contohmya delete road. In addition there is also the editor of Writer, Writer is a method in shape file to create a new shp file.

**Suggestion**
More increase knowledge and find other references to the practice material editor in geographic information system science course that direct implementation or practice in order to make a direct GIS
