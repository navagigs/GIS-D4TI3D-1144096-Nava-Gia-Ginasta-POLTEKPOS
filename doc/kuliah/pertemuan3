Background
==========
Cartography is the study of the depiction of the map of the earth's surface. Wikepedia mention Cartography (or mapmaking) is the study and practice of making maps or globes. Maps have traditionally been made using pen and paper, but the emergence and spread of computers revolutionized cartography. Some foreign dictionaries mention cartography as art and science of graphically representing a geographic area, usually by means of a map or chart. Political, cultural, or other nongeographic features may be superimposed.

Cartography can be said is a discipline that has existed since time immemorial even in prehistoric times katografi been used by man to describe his territory, hunting grounds and areas for fishing. During the Babylonian map of the world is described as a flat area, Ptolemy in the second century has developed a spherical shape of the earth in the form. The maps were created in the Middle Ages used the model used by Ptolemy.

There internationalatau cartographic association or ICA International Cartographic Association which was established on June 9, 1959, in Bern, Switzerland. Cartography has grown from the depiction of the earth's surface with a pen on paper with the depiction digitally via a computer program (a program or a CAD and GIS). These developments in the field of cartography which later becomes the GIS. However in studying the GIS must first learn the basics of cartography. Basics of cartography is by studying and understanding the basic concepts of the map.

Map is a picture of the earth's surface is poured into a flat plane. According to ICA maps is a portrait conventional picture elements that exist on the surface of the earth and the symptoms of the elements illustrated.

The role of the map is to illustrate the position, describing the size and describe the forms of the phenomenon described dalampeta proficiency level. Map has a role that is diverse and expanding the role of the beginning of the map is to the means of information of its users to the map makers that aims to communicate a position somewhere and used for navigation. Map later evolved into the basis for the analysis of all the phenomena that exist in the Earth's surface in relation to the spatial aspect, at this stage maps can be used to calculate a phenomenon, making predictions based on the linkage of the phenomenon of spatial and eventually become a tool for the analysis of the various aspects related to spatial ,

There are various types of maps that can be differentiated based on several categories as follows:

Based scale map
Map scale can be made in the detail and scale that no detail. The more detailed the map scale accuracy of the map will be getting better and the picture of the object in the map is also more similar to actual conditions.

Based on the existing content on the map
Based on the contents of the map, it can be distinguished on the basis of maps and thematic maps. The base map is a map that is made to describe the general conditions of an area and illustrates these features such as rivers, roads, contour / line elevation, administrative boundaries, key locations such as residential centers, and a general overview of land cover.

Thematic maps can be very diverse and illustrated by highlighting certain aspects in accordance with the purpose of making maps. Thematic maps such as a map of land use, soil type maps, geological maps, maps of rainfall, etc.

To create a cartographic map there are rules that must be met, that the map should make users able to read the map by youth. To make it easier to read the map then prepare maps must meet the minimum requirements such as their title, scale, direction of the wind and the legend of the map.

The components contained in the map are:
- Title Map
- Sekala
- Indicator Directions Mata Angin
- Legend / Description symbol on the map
- System Projection / Coordinate System and Datum
- Sources of data and retrieval time / year
- Index Location

**problem solution**
To develop a geographical image creation requires raster or vector for the manufacture of an object location of an object in the form of altitude, location of the city, because the raster or vector we can create patterns with what we want.

**Conclusions and recommendations**
Geographic Information System can create maps and object location of an object in the form of altitude, the location of the town, which we prefer.
Preparation and implementation must be real and immediate so easy to understand
