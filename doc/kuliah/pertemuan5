**Background**

In the use of Geographic Information Systems, there are many among us who do not know how to use the data in geospatial data. Geographical Information Systems I will explain how to create geospatial data in shapefile import and incorporate variablenya using python programming language and also how to use classes and methods in python.

**problem solution**

Creating a Geospatial Data
1. Import shapefiles
2. Enter the variable, eg a variable to shapefile.writer ()
a = shapefile.writer ()
So, make geospatial data formats No 2, namely:
1. shp => a.point (x, y)
a.poly [(x, y), (v, w)]
2. .dbf => a.field ( 'name.field', 'c', '40')
a.record ( 'bdg')
Geospatial data is stored using a method a.save ( 'file.shp').
Meaning of the method in the writer:
- Point (x, y): insert data in the form of paint into shp and all data must be formatted ESRI.1
- Poly [(a, b), (c, d)]: polygon-shaped insert geospatial data (back to the starting point) or polyline (not back to point early).
- Field ( 'name', 'c', '40'): it means making the polygon attribute table 'name' with varchar data type with a length of 40. This method can be repeated and can be done for krbuthan new field again.
- Record ( 'Bandung'): Fill in the table with only one field value 'Bandung'.
- Save ( 'nama.file'): save file to save the file.

**Conclusion**

By getting the data we are also not necessarily shp we can see that data, but we also have to use an application like-QGIS and Python to find a place.
**Suggestion**

Learn more about the use of QGIS and Python in order to know and mepatakan layout information using the script of a region or place.
