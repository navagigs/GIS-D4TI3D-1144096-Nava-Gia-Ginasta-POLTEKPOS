Background
==========
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) or the Geographic Information System (GIS) is an information system designed to work with data referenced spatial or berkoordinat geography or in other words, a GIS is a database system with specific capabilities for handling data referenced spatial ( spatial) together with a set of work operations.


The main objective of the utilization of Geographic Information System is to make it easier to get the information that has been processed and stored as an attribute of a location or object. The main characteristic of data that can be used in Geographic Information Systems is the data that has been bound by the location and the basic data are not yet specified.


Presentation of spatial data has three basic ways, namely in the form of dots, lines and shapes form area (polygon). The point is a single appearance of a pair of x, y coordinates that show the location of an object in the form of altitude, location of the city, the location of the sample and others. Line is a collection of dots that make up an elongated appearance such as rivers, roads, kontus and others. While the appearance of the area is bounded by a line that forms a homogeneous space, for example: border, limit the use of land, islands and so forth.


Spatial data structure divided into two data model raster and vector data model. Raster data is data that is stored in the form of a rectangular box (grid) / cell to form a regular room. Vector data is the data recorded in the form of point coordinates that display, placing and storing spatial data using points, lines or areas (polygon).


**problem solution**
To develop a geographical image creation requires raster or vector for the manufacture of an object location of an object in the form of altitude, location of the city, because the raster or vector we can create patterns with what we want.

**Conclusions and recommendations**
Geographic Information System can create maps and object location of an object in the form of altitude, the location of the town, which we prefer.
Preparation and implementation must be real and immediate so easy to understand
